        <p id="statement">At the Youth Inquiry Network, our mission is simple yet profound: to empower high school students like you to become confident researchers, critical thinkers, and effective communicators. We believe that every student has the potential to make meaningful contributions to the world through research and scholarly inquiry. However, our commitment doesn't stop there. We recognize the lingering financial barriers that often stand between young researchers and their research journey which is why we are also committed to providing accessible and affordable solutions for research publication. It's our aim to ensure that students have the right training and guidance to share and conduct research without breaking the bank.</p>
